A book recently made me cry. This is the first time I've cried in years, and the first time it was over a book.

When Breath Becomes Air, by Paul Kalanithi, is a memoir about a man who becomes a neurosurgeon and then a cancer patient. It's a story about love, loss, and the journey of living.




### Thoughts
- A book made a cry 
- Follow up to "You have to enjoy the journey"
- When breath becomes air

- When I initially was talking about the book, I thought it was going to be about someone with regret, wasting their life in med school and only then trying to live after being diagnosed with cancer.
- But it's not. 
- It's actually quite the opposite. It's his story of his strong will to push on, even when he was given a timer.
